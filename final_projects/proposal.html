                <h2>Breakdown of Features</h2>
                <p>
                    In this scene, the queen Rennala stands on the ocean, pointing to the front with her Carian Regal Scepter. Behind her, 
                    there is a gaint full moon, which we think is a good emitter that may fulfill several requirements below. Also, we can 
                    try to model Rennala using blender or find an alternative model. In addition, to retreive a realistic scene, we can be 
                    able to apply environment map emitter to the gaint moon and its shadow.
                </p>
                <h3>Shaoyan Li (60 points)</h3>
                <h4>1. Depth of Field - 5 points</h4>
                <p>
                    Different objects have different depth. In this scene, the figure covered part of the moon as well as its shadow. 
                </p>
                <h4>2. Procedural Textures - 5 points</h4>
                <p>
                    We want to apply different kinds of procedural textures on the standing ground, although it's fluid for now.  
                </p>
                <h4>3. Textured Area Emitters - 5 points</h4>
                <p>
                    There are 2 emitters(could be more), the full moon and the weapon held by the Boss. We would apply textures on them.
                </p> 
                <h4>4. Bump Mapping - 5 points</h4>
                <p>
                    We can apply it on one of the objects in this scene. 
                </p>

                <h4>5. Mip-mapping for Textures - 10 points</h4>
                <p>
                    Used for anti-aliasing.
                </p>

                <h4>6. Spectral Rendering - 15 points</h4>
                <p>
                    We would model the scene's light transport with real wavelengths.
                </p>

                <h4>7. Disney BSDF (only 5 parameters) - 15 points</h4>
                <p>
                    Implementation of 5 parameters of the Disney BSDF.
                    They are metallic, specular, specularTint, roughness and anisotropic.
                </p>

                <h3>Yufeng Xiao (60 points)</h3>

                <h4>1. Model Your Own Mesh - 5 points</h4>
                <p>
                    We also want to model objects not shown in this scene, such as a wooden boat, a specular sphere.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Object Motion Blur - 10 points</h4>
                <p>
                    Add motion blur when the boss fire magic.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Environment Map Emitter - 15 points</h4>
                <p>
                    We could use a spherical object in this scene as the environment map emitter.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Heterogeneous Participating Media - 30 points</h4>
                <p>
                    We would add heterogeneous medium like fog in our scene so that we can apply this technique.
